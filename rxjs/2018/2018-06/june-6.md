  * Discussed a few folks we'd love to groom for the core team meeting
  
  * Discussion about core team
    * Core team members need to continue to have context in RxJS. (Persons who have no context in RxJS core with write access pose a risk to the library.)

    * In order to stay a core team member, members need to be present at pre-scheduled meetings at least once a month. 

    * Core team members need to also be actively contributing monthly. 

    * Eligibility for core team members and/or write access  to the repo will be reviewed at core team meetings and voted based on consensus on a quarterly basis. 

    * Consensus to change some settings members who are currently not actively involved.
