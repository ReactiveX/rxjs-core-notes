## Discussed

- Top-level exports. The vast majority of the community seems to be behind the change and very excited. Igor Minar of the Angular Team has expressed concern. Ben will meet with Igor later today to see what we can do to alleviate those concerns.
- Bazel and Bazel builds. The addition of the Bazel file(s) in 5.5.5 was just to support users who want to build with Bazel (This is primarily Angular users going forward). Ben talked with Alex Eagle who is going to run a Bazel hackathon in late December to try to move RxJS's build to Bazel. This might mesh well with Ward Peter's desire to help move us to a monorepo. Ward has expressed interest in trying to use Bazel for this.
- Jan. 3 Core meeting cancelled because of Holidays.
- When we're back from break in January, we're going to focus on adding some structure to the team and what it means to be a "core team member" participation-wise.
