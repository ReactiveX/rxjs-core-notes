### Items Discussed

* How big will the updates for the RxJS 6 documentation and what are current efforts around it?
  * Need documenation on how to migrate to RxJS6 - Jason Aiden from Angular team is working on it.
  * Need to update examples to not use the old global.

* What is the timeline for the POC for Angular.io?
  * Pete pulled all the documentation out of the code files and we need to go through and update it.
  * We can release the POC on the internet now.
  * Fix the POC - take all the static content and change the branding from it.
  * We should integrate Stackblitz with Pete's stuff.
  * Think about how to integrate real world examples or other examples we would like to have.
  * For Angular they create full fledged examples in the source code and they automatically turn them into stackblitz links.
  * Current POC is on the Angular repo.
  * We're going to need to migrate all the infrastructure from the Angular repo POC to a new repo.

2. Fix all the Angular branding from POC to remove.

5. Contributing to the documentation application & contributing documentation.
6. Release the new docs. 

### Other Items
