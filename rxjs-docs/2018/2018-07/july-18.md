  * Jan-Niklas has been leading most of the docs initiative - thank you!!
  * Matt Yao has been helping out a lot! Thank you Matt!
  * Martin Sikora made a really great PR - thank you Martin!

* Docs reconciliation
  * We should close the old RxJS docs repo soon or make it read only after reconciliation
  * Need the "choose your operator" functionality back
  * Still need to reconcile from all other docs - Jan-Niklas and Tracy will create a screencast so folks can help contribute to this.

* Travis builds have been failing - speak to OJ about this during core meeting

* Google Analytics issue from Stephen Fluin - we should fix that for the docs firebase app.

* Taking off beta
  * Jan-Niklas brought up that we should take URL changes very seriously and SEO implications before we think about removing the beta.
  * After speaking with Ben about this he just wants to remove and doesn't think any of this will be affected.
